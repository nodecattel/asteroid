Current Status Analysis üîç
After reviewing the code against your feature document, here's what I found:

‚úÖ What's Already Working:
Dynamic market loading with volume data (just implemented)
Secure API credentials in .env (just implemented)
Real-time WebSocket order updates
Commission tracking and fee calculation
Rate limit protection
Volume generation with batch orders
‚ùå Critical Missing Features:
1. NO Native TP/SL Orders

The bot currently only places LIMIT orders for volume generation
When trades execute and create positions, NO automatic stop-loss or take-profit orders are placed
This means positions are completely unprotected
2. NO Position Management

No position tracking system
No position PnL monitoring
No position closure controls
Cannot monitor open positions or their risk levels
3. NO Risk Management

No stop-loss protection (native or manual)
No take-profit automation
No trailing stop-loss
No emergency circuit breaker
No position health monitoring
üîß What Needs to Be Built:
Based on your feature document, I need to implement:

Dual-Layer Stop-Loss Protection

Layer 1: Place native STOP_MARKET orders on Asterdex when position opens
Layer 2: Manual checking every cycle as fallback
Automated Take-Profit

Layer 1: Place native TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET orders
Layer 2: Manual checking as fallback
Trailing Stop-Loss

Track peak profit levels
Dynamically adjust stop-loss
Use TRAILING_STOP_MARKET order type
Emergency Circuit Breaker

Monitor total account unrealized PnL
Auto-close all positions if threshold exceeded
Position Health Monitoring

Real-time position PnL tracking
Early warnings at 50% and 75% of stop-loss
Position risk indicators
Position Management UI

Display open positions with entry price, current price, PnL
Show TP/SL levels
Manual position closure controls
The good news: The Asterdex API client already supports all the necessary order types (STOP_MARKET, TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET, TRAILING_STOP_MARKET) and parameters (stopPrice, activationPrice, callbackRate, workingType). We just need to use them in the bot engine.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these critical risk management features? This is a significant enhancement that will add proper position protection according to the Asterdex API documentation.
